### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**BlockDepth/BlockDepth** is a âœ¨ Vodcast Showâœ¨ but this is the actual repository of the under development as well as our website.  `README.md` will appear on our GitHub profile to demonstrate that we can code.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the development of my show's episodes, content,  and get over my imposter syndrome and showcase my knowledge on the technological and non-technological misconceptions in blockchain. To open the dialogue with institutions and individuals that are currently actively working on blockchain technology. 

My unique ability delivers clarity to complex topics dissolving negative connotations surrounding our ecosystem, more importantly is to dispel common myths to improve the mainstream perceptions & acceptance of our On-Chain Technology as the future. BlockDepth aims to blow the whistle on blockchain misconceptions, separating fact from fiction and highlighting the potential impact blockchain technology projects have to offer.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about how to explain the confusions about blockchain and their relationships to Cryptocurrencies, to educate and to keep listeners up to date on the latest crypto and blockchain news and events 

- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to create BlockDepth Vodcast as an exclusive showroom of on-chain knowledge, helping you separate fact from fiction, demonstrating the ongoing proof of work, highlighting the benefits and potential impacts it could have as this technology still in its early days. BlockDepth On-Chain is a group of individuals, organizations that have to come together to learn, teach educate and share the projects blockchain has to offer. 


- ğŸ’¬ Discuss and engage with me as part of our community, exchanging updates, and breaking developments in blockchain + decentralized systems. Iâ€™m looking to achieve this through the channel of technology, experience & community. Bridging the gap between the blockchain industry and others by identifying common questions and misperceptions, removing bias and creating a transparent environment Discussing blockchain solutions for the real world, voicing our crypto ecosystem community.
