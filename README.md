In a Blockchain eat Blockchain world! I’m BlockDepth.eth and I bring clarity of thought to complex ideas, 
simply and without jargon for the crypto curious! BlockDepth.eth is a publication concept founded by a 
revolutionary CEO and Tech Founder who brings clarity of thought to complex ideas around emerging 
Decentralized Technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and Web3.

The term “Web3” is often limited and reductive as it is described as a trend. A new meaning to the term 
should be adopted, as the New Iteration of the Internet emphasizes the Value of People. I suggest using 
the more accurate Internet of People or IoP instead of Web3.

I aim to bridge the gap between the Cryptoverse and Mainstream Culture by highlighting the benefits and 
potential impacts of these technologies while making them accessible to those who are new to the space. 
We achieve this by providing examples and real-world use cases to help readers understand how these 
technologies work.

One of my favorite pastimes is to dispel common myths and confusions about Blockchain and the Cryptoverse, 
enabling readers to make informed decisions about the future of this transformative technology.

The Cryptoverse refers to the decentralized ecosystem and its various components, including Ethereum 
Mainnet, Blockchains, Cryptocurrencies, Smart Contracts, and NFTs. Our mission is to comprehensively 
understand these emerging technologies shaping our world.
